The goal of the project is to build small descriptive parkour for a bunch point of interest with naration.
    The end user experience should be as follow
    1. The user scan a QR code with his phone and open a web page
    2. The user can select a city then one of the walking tour available
    3. The responsive web page is optimized for mobile and display to following element
        - A compass pointing to a location
        - A distance toward that location 
        - A play button the hear naration
        - The title of the point of interest
        - Buttons to navigate between the next or the previous point of interest
        - Controls to change the language French/English/Spanish/Chinese
    4. The user can do the walking tour and can rate the activity.
    5. I expect that the user can always go back to a previous place and change the walking tour.

    For the administrative side of it
    1- I can create/edit a new city
    2- I can create/edit a new walking tour for a specific city and to do that i can:
        - Add a point of interest
        - Set its lattitude and longitude
        - Upload an audio file for a specific language
        - Write the title of the point of interest
    3- I can activate or deactivate point of interest
    4- Access to the administrative side is handle by an authentication process

Personally I rate UX over UI, the web page will be use outside and very probably on sunny days making the contrast very important. The button to start the naration and the indication towards the next point of interest must be clear, simple and meaningfull for the user.
